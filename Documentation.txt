1] Purpose: Beyond catastrophe analysis, Black Boxes (EDRs or ADRs) in automobiles record events to proactively 
detect issues (e.g., engine faults) and monitor fleet activities (e.g., over-speeding), aiding in proactive maintenance.

2] Modern Usage: Given today's busy lifestyle, a Black Box logs critical car activities and takes actions against 
rash driving, helping to track vehicle usage and control efficiency.

3] Proposed Solution: Log events like gear shifts, current speed, engine temperature, fuel consumption, trip distance, etc.
Provide password-based access for transport managers to view or download logs.
Extend to IoT by exporting data to a cloud-based server for centralized monitoring.

4] Goal: Implement a Black Box using a PIC microcontroller and simulate events by interfacing with sensors.
